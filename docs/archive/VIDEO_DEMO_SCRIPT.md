## INTRO (0:00-0:20)

**[SCREEN: Landing page with animated gradient background]**

> "Meet Sarah. She drives for Uber, delivers for DoorDash, and earned $47,000 last year working the gig economy.
>
> But here's the problem: **no employer means no benefits**. No health insurance. No 401(k). No safety net.
>
> That's where **Portable** comes in."

**[Show logo - three overlapping gradient circles]**

---

## PROBLEM (0:20-0:45)

**[SCREEN: Scroll through landing page features]**

> "Over 60 million Americans work independentlyâ€”driving rideshare, delivering food, creating content, freelancing online. The freedom is incredible.
>
> But traditional benefits are **tied to employers**. When you're self-employed or juggling multiple gigs, you're left out of the system entirely.
>
> Portable changes that. We're a financial platform built specifically for gig workersâ€”because your work is already portable. Your benefits should be too."

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW (0:45-1:10)

**[SCREEN: Show dashboard login - sarah.driver@email.com]**

> "Let me show you how it works. This is Sarah's dashboard."

**[SCREEN: Home page with income overview]**

> "First, we track income across **all platforms** automatically. Sarah connects her bank account, uploads a CSV, and Portable parses every paymentâ€”Uber, DoorDash, Upwork, everything.
>
> We show her total earnings, auto-calculate quarterly taxes, and track her income stability in real-time."

## SCREEN 1: HOME PAGE (1:10-1:45)

**[SCREEN: Home page - scroll through sections]**

**Income Overview Cards:**

**Platform Breakdown:**
> "She's crushing it on Uberâ€”her top earner at $1,800 this month. DoorDash is strong at $900. But Upwork? She's leaving money on the table."

**Personalized Tips:**
> "Based on her platforms and location, we show actionable tips: maximize Uber earnings in her city, track mileage deductions, build an emergency fund.
>
> These aren't genericâ€”they're specific to **her** situation."

**Recommended Actions:**
> "Quick wins: connect Instacart to diversify income, set up a Solo 401(k), get health insurance. One-click access to everything she needs."

---

## SCREEN 2: INCOME TRACKER (1:45-2:05)

**[SCREEN: Click "Income" tab]**

> - Self-employment tax (15.3%)
> - Federal income tax
> - State tax estimates
> - Total liability: **$8,942**
>
> We break it into **quarterly payments**: $2,236 due every quarter to avoid penalties."

**[SCREEN: Show payment schedule with deadlines]**

> - Health insurance: âœ… 100% covered through the ACA Marketplace
> - Emergency fund: 40% thereâ€”$3,600 saved, targeting 3 months of expenses
> - Retirement: 25% on trackâ€”contributing $500/month to a Roth IRA"

**[SCREEN: Show health insurance calculator]**
