## What's Left to Do

### 🔴 Critical for Production (3 items)

1. **GDPR Data Export Feature** (2 days)
   - Implement `/api/user/export` endpoint
   - JSON and CSV format support
   - Include all user data (transactions, income, profile)

2. **Privacy Policy & Terms** (1 week)
   - Legal review required
   - Detail all data processing activities
   - List all subprocessors (Supabase, Plaid, Vercel)

3. **Rate Limiting** (1 day)
   - Protect all API endpoints
   - Use Upstash Redis or Vercel KV
   - 10 requests/10 seconds per IP

### ⚠️ Pending User Configuration (4 items)

1. **Plaid Integration Testing**
   - User needs to create Plaid developer account
   - Set up production credentials
   - Test end-to-end flow

2. **Supabase SMTP Configuration**
   - Configure email service (SendGrid/Resend/SES)
   - Set up SMTP in Supabase dashboard
   - Test email sending

3. **Password Reset Flow**
   - Depends on SMTP configuration
   - Test reset email delivery

4. **Email Verification Flow**
   - Depends on SMTP configuration
   - Test verification email

### 🟢 Optional (Business Decision)

1. **Payment/Subscription System**
   - Stripe integration
   - Only needed if monetizing

| Infrastructure | ⚠️ PENDING | Needs deployment and SMTP |

---

## Deployment Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Beta Launch
- All core features functional
- Strong security foundation
- Excellent performance
- US-based users only (GDPR/CCPA gaps)

### ⚠️ Not Ready for Production
- Missing GDPR data export
- No privacy policy
- No rate limiting
- No error monitoring
- SMTP not configured

**Estimated Time to Production**: 2-3 weeks
- Week 1: Data export, rate limiting, security headers
- Week 2: Privacy policy, beta testing with 10 users
- Week 3: Bug fixes, refinements, final testing

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Email System**: Built templates and service, but sending requires user SMTP setup
2. **Demo Data**: Included in onboarding for instant testing experience
3. **CSV Upload**: Prioritized over Plaid-only approach for flexibility
4. **Settings Page**: Full-featured with password change, profile update, account deletion
5. **Performance**: Optimized for 10k-50k transactions per user (no archiving needed yet)
6. **Security**: RLS-based authorization (no custom middleware needed)
