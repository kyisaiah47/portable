## Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with secure cookie-based sessions
2. **Authorization**: Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables
3. **Data Protection**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
4. **Environment Variables**: Properly secured, validated at startup
5. **SQL Injection**: Protected by Supabase client library
6. **XSS**: Protected by React's automatic escaping
7. **Sensitive Data**: No logging of passwords, tokens, or keys
8. **Third-Party Security**: Plaid integration uses read-only access

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerabilities

1. **No Rate Limiting**: API endpoints vulnerable to abuse
2. **Missing Security Headers**: No CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
3. **No Audit Logging**: Can't track sensitive operations
4. **Service Role Key**: Used in cron jobs without audit trail
5. **Webhook Verification**: Plaid webhooks lack signature verification
6. **CORS**: No explicit CORS policy configured

**Risk Level**: MODERATE
**See**: [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](./SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for full details

# Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
# SSL certificate auto-provisioned by Vercel
```

### Step 3: Configure Supabase Production

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename LIKE 'portable_%';

-- Verify indexes exist
SELECT indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('portable_transactions', 'portable_users', 'portable_parsed_income');

-- Create backup (Supabase dashboard)
-- Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups ‚Üí Create Backup
```

### Step 4: Test Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Test signup flow
# Visit: https://getportable.app/signup
# Create account, verify email redirect

# 2. Test CSV upload
# Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Upload Transactions
# Upload real bank CSV, verify parsing

# 3. Test dashboard data
# Verify income shows correctly
# Check stability score calculation
# Test tax calculator

# 4. Test settings
# Update profile
# Change password
# Test account deletion (with test account)

# 5. Test error handling

- Verify backups are running

**Monthly**:
- Review user growth and transaction volume
- Check for missing indexes (slow queries)
- Analyze Supabase costs vs free tier limits

**Quarterly**:
- Run performance tests (scripts/performance-test.ts)
- Review and update RLS policies
- Security audit for new features

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Supabase Free Tier**: 500 concurrent connections, 8GB storage
2. **No Email Sending**: Requires SMTP configuration
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Vulnerable to API abuse
4. **CSV Format Support**: Works with most US banks, may need tweaking for international formats
5. **Income Detection**: Platform detection is regex-based (may miss obscure platforms)
6. **Tax Calculations**: US federal only (no state/local taxes)
7. **No Multi-Currency**: USD only currently
8. **No Mobile App**: Web-only (responsive design works on mobile)

### Known Bugs

**None reported** - This is a greenfield project

### Future Enhancements

**High Priority**:
1. State tax calculations (CA, NY, TX most common)
2. Multi-currency support (CAD, EUR, GBP)
3. Mobile app (React Native or Flutter)
4. Expense tracking and categorization
5. Receipt scanning (OCR)
6. Integration with accounting software (QuickBooks, FreshBooks)

**Medium Priority**:
7. Budgeting and savings goals
8. Financial forecasting / projections
9. Multi-user support (accountant access)
10. Custom platform detection rules
11. Bank statement PDF upload (OCR)
12. Webhook for Plaid transaction updates
