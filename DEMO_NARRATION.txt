Right now, there are 70 million gig workers in America. And most of them have no idea how much money they're actually making.

You drive for Uber, deliver for DoorDash, freelance on Upwork. Five different apps. Five different payment schedules. Zero clarity on what you actually earned this month.

And then tax season hits. You're scrambling through bank statements, trying to remember which gas station charges were for work. Was that oil change in March or April? How much did you even make in Q2?

The IRS doesn't care that you're juggling six income streams. They want their money. Quarterly.

Most gig workers either overpay by thousands because they're scared, or underpay and get destroyed by penalties.

There's nothing out there that solves this. QuickBooks? Built for traditional businesses. Mint? Doesn't understand gig work. Your tax software? Only helps once a year, when it's already too late.

The gig economy is 40% of the American workforce, and there's no financial platform built for how they actually work.

So we built Portable. The first financial platform designed from the ground up for gig workers.

You upload your bank statement once. That's it. Portable does everything else.

It automatically identifies income from over 50 platforms. Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Upwork, Fiverr, YouTube, Patreon - we recognize them all.

You see exactly what you made, broken down by platform, by week, by month. No more guessing. No more spreadsheets.

We calculate your income stability score. Are you earning consistently, or is it all over the place? This matters for getting approved for apartments, loans, credit cards. Gig workers get rejected all the time because traditional credit systems don't understand variable income.

We're fixing that.

But here's where it gets powerful. Portable automatically categorizes your business expenses.

Gas stations? We know those are deductible for rideshare and delivery. Phone bills? 80% deductible for gig workers. That Adobe subscription? Fully deductible if you're a creator.

Every single transaction gets analyzed, categorized, and calculated for your tax deduction. The average gig worker misses $3,000 to $5,000 in deductions every year because they don't track this properly.

That's real money. That's rent.

And the taxes. This is the big one.

Portable calculates your exact quarterly tax liability in real-time. Self-employment tax, federal income tax, estimated state tax. You know exactly what you owe, when you owe it.

No more panic in April. No more underpayment penalties because you forgot to pay estimated taxes in June.

We show you the quarterly deadlines. We tell you how much to set aside. We even project your full-year tax burden based on your current earnings trajectory.

You're not guessing anymore. You have a number.

We also connect you with services that actually work for gig workers. Health insurance plans that understand variable income. Retirement accounts designed for self-employed people. Financial tools built for your reality.

And because we know what platforms you work on and what cities you're in, we show you hyper-relevant guides. How to maximize earnings during surge in your city. Best zones for delivery. Tax strategies specific to creators.

This isn't generic financial advice. This is built for you.

Look, the gig economy isn't going away. It's growing. But gig workers have been left behind by every major financial institution.

Banks don't understand you. Credit bureaus penalize you for variable income. Tax software treats you like an afterthought.

Portable changes that. We're building the financial infrastructure that gig workers actually need. Income tracking. Expense management. Tax planning. Benefits. Education. All in one place.

This is what financial software looks like when it's built for how people actually work in 2025.

This is Portable. Financial clarity for gig workers.

Upload your statement. See your income. Know your taxes. Keep more of your money.
