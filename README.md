## 🏆 HackNomics 2025 Alignment

This project directly addresses the **economic inequality** facing America's rapidly growing gig workforce:

- ✅ **Real-World Impact**: Tackles the benefits gap affecting 60M+ workers
- ✅ **Financial Innovation**: Portable benefits system that moves between gigs

## 💡 Why "Portable"?

Traditional benefits are **tied to employers**. When you change jobs or work multiple gigs, you lose access.

**Portable** changes this by creating benefits that:
- Follow you from gig to gig
- Work across multiple platforms simultaneously
- Don't require a single employer
- Are designed for independent workers

**Your work is already portable. Your benefits should be too.**
